NOT WORKING

This repo is only a snapshot to show my Rust learning speed and the applicability of my non-Rust background to Rust programming, see the next 6 hours at https://github.com/kermit4/first_8_hours_of_rust     

If run with no args, it is intended to listen for uploads - not yet working

With args it is intened to send a file - unwritten
